# IzzyNFTs

A Python bot that integrates NFT trading into Discord and Telegram -- allowing surfing, selling, buying, and bidding without leaving a messaging app. Itâ€™s much easier and faster than using traditional NFT marketplaces/apps.

The bot allows you to check the contents of (now just Solana) crypto wallets using public keys. IzzyNFTs bot syncs public keys to the messenger @username during registration. Thus, if a person is registered, you can view and buy their collections simply by searching up their @UN. 


Created and presented for the first time at the the Solana Moscow Hacker House hackathon in February 2022.

Initially, IzzyNFTs was created on the Solana blockchain, but soon it will support all popular blockchain networks. Additionally, it now supports on Telegram, we are currently working on Discord.
